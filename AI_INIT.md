# Project Overview

This project is developed entirely by an AI agent, with commands provided by the user. The `AI_INIT.md` file will be updated throughout the project's development to reflect progress.
So just in this project, AI help is needed much more. Recommend more code completions and commands to the AI agent, and I will update the `AI_INIT.md` file accordingly.
